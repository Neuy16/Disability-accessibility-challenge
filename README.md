# Disability-Accessibility-Challenge

## Description

- A company asked me to make their webpage more accessible for users with visual disabilities, and to format the code in a way that met accessibility standards so it can be optimized for search engines. 
- By refactoring the code provided, I was able to make the web page easier to navigate for users that are visually impaired. The tags/alts that were added to picutures and the title also allow for the webpage to list higher on the search list as it adheres to accessibility standards and can be found using the implimented key terms.
- By working on this ticket I learned that it is extrememly important to allow everyone, no matter what disability they might have, to have equal access to the information given by this webpage.
